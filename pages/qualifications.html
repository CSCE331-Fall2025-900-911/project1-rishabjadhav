            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Docker &amp; Kubernetes</li>

            I have experience building web applications using Java and Spring in personal projects, such as Yummerz, the REST API I built using Spring
            and MVC architecture to create, read, update, and delete recipe objects. I also worked with Java and Spring during my summer internship at 
            Raytheon, where I managed legacy Java APIs in an enterprise application context. I also have experience with using Python, as well as Python
            libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and sci kit learn for machine learning. I worked with these technologies to try to predict the 
            NFL MVP winner using Data Science. This involved web scraping with Selenium, HTML parsing, and data manipulation. Finally, using linear regression
            machine learning models, I trained a model to predict the NFL MVP. 
            My skills also extend to web development. I have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build an Overwatch 2 counterpick tool, that advises users what
            heroes counter other heroes. In addition to this, with TAMU Datathon, I worked with a team in building a webpage for March Madness bracket submissions as part
            of a tournament. This webpage took user submissions using a interactive bracket UI that I built.

          <h2>Technical Areas of Interest</h2>
          <p>
            I am mostly interested in whatever technological concept I'm working with at the time, or get the opportunity to explore. Right now, I am interested
            in pursuing a minor in Cybersecurity at Texas A&M alongside my Bachelor's in Computer Science. In addition to this, I continue to explore data science
            and analytics in my role of Challenges Team Lead with TAMU Datathon. We build data science and machine learning challenges for a 24 hour hackathon in the
            Fall. Software development is also an area of interest with me, where I got exposure during my internship. I would like to learn more about any and all
            computing and technological concepts that I can.
